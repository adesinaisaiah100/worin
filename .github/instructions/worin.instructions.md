Here are the specific hex codes for that "Royal Dignity" theme. These colors will look professional, warm, and high-end.

The Palette Codes

1. Primary Color (Deep Royal Purple)

Hex: #2E1A47

Where to use: The navigation bar, the footer, and huge headlines. This is your "dignity" color.

2. Secondary Color (Muted Gold)

Hex: #C5A059

Where to use: Small accents (like lines under headings), icons, or the background for the "Testimonial" section.

3. Background Color (Soft Cream)

Hex: #FDFBF7

Where to use: The main page background. Do not use pure white (#FFFFFF); use this instead. It is softer on the eyes and feels warmer.

4. The CTA "HELP" Button (Bright Marigold)

Hex: #FFB81C

Where to use: ONLY for the "HELP" buttons.

Note: Use Black text (#000000) or the Deep Purple (#2E1A47) inside this button to make it easy to read. Do not use white text inside this yellow button (it will be hard to read).

Quick Implementation Guide for the Hero Section

Since we are focusing on the Hero right now:

Background: Use the Deep Royal Purple (#2E1A47) as the background color (if you aren't using the full-screen video).

Text: Make the headline text Soft Cream (#FDFBF7).

Sub-text: Make the sub-text slightly transparent white (or light gray).

Button: The button background is Marigold (#FFB81C) and the text inside the button says HELP in Deep Purple (#2E1A47).
